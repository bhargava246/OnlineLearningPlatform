# EduPlatform - Learning Management System

## Overview

EduPlatform is a full-stack learning management system built with modern web technologies. It provides a comprehensive platform for online education with features for students, instructors, and administrators. The application follows a traditional client-server architecture with a React frontend and Express.js backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: CSS variables for theming with dark/light mode support

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with JSON responses
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development

### Project Structure
- `/client/` - React frontend application
- `/server/` - Express.js backend application
- `/shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and database schema
- `/migrations/` - Database migration files (generated by Drizzle)

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive database schema with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Student, instructor, and admin accounts with role-based access
- **Courses**: Course catalog with metadata, thumbnails, and instructor assignments

- **Course Notes**: Downloadable PDF resources associated with courses
- **Enrollments**: Student-course relationships with progress tracking
- **Tests**: Assessment system for courses
- **Test Results**: Student performance tracking
- **Recent Activities**: User activity logging for dashboard insights

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Primary**: Email/password authentication with JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- **Secondary**: Replit OpenID Connect authentication as fallback option
- Role-based access control (student, instructor, admin)
- **User Approval Workflow**: New students require admin approval before accessing courses
- Session-based authentication for Replit auth, JWT for email/password auth

### User Interface Components
- **Dashboard**: Personalized learning overview with statistics
- **Course Catalog**: Browsable course listings with search and filtering
- **Course Player**: Video playback with progress tracking and note downloads
- **Test Results**: Performance analytics and grade tracking

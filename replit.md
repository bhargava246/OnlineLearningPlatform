# EduPlatform - Learning Management System

## Overview

EduPlatform is a full-stack learning management system built with modern web technologies. It provides a comprehensive platform for online education with features for students, instructors, and administrators. The application follows a traditional client-server architecture with a React frontend and Express.js backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: CSS variables for theming with dark/light mode support

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with JSON responses
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development

### Project Structure
- `/client/` - React frontend application
- `/server/` - Express.js backend application
- `/shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and database schema
- `/migrations/` - Database migration files (generated by Drizzle)

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive database schema with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Student, instructor, and admin accounts with role-based access
- **Courses**: Course catalog with metadata, thumbnails, and instructor assignments
- **Course Modules**: Individual video lessons with ordering and completion tracking
- **Course Notes**: Downloadable PDF resources associated with courses
- **Enrollments**: Student-course relationships with progress tracking
- **Tests**: Assessment system for courses
- **Test Results**: Student performance tracking
- **Recent Activities**: User activity logging for dashboard insights

### Authentication & Authorization
- Simple username/password authentication
- Role-based access control (student, instructor, admin)
- Session-based authentication (no JWT implementation visible)

### User Interface Components
- **Dashboard**: Personalized learning overview with statistics
- **Course Catalog**: Browsable course listings with search and filtering
- **Course Player**: Video playback with progress tracking and note downloads
- **Test Results**: Performance analytics and grade tracking
- **Admin Panel**: System administration and analytics

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. Frontend makes HTTP requests to `/api` endpoints
2. Backend processes requests with Express middleware
3. Database operations handled through Drizzle ORM
4. Responses sent as JSON with appropriate HTTP status codes

### State Management Flow
1. Components use TanStack Query for data fetching
2. Query keys correspond to API endpoints
3. Automatic caching and background refetching
4. Loading and error states handled declaratively

### File Upload/Download
- Course thumbnails and video URLs stored as text references
- PDF notes served through download URLs
- Static assets served from `/public` directory

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Date Utilities**: date-fns for date formatting
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **Carousel**: Embla Carousel for image galleries

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connection
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session store
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking

### Development Tools
- **Build**: esbuild for server bundling
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database Tools**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Replit-based development with auto-reload
- Vite dev server with HMR for frontend
- tsx with file watching for backend development
- PostgreSQL database provided by Replit

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite production build to `/dist/public`
- Backend: esbuild bundle to `/dist/index.js`
- Static file serving integrated with Express
- Environment-based configuration

### Replit Configuration
- Node.js 20 runtime environment
- PostgreSQL 16 database service
- Auto-scaling deployment target
- Port 5000 exposed externally on port 80

### Database Management
- Drizzle migrations for schema changes
- Environment variable for database connection
- Automatic schema push for development
